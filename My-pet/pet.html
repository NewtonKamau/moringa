  <p> My pet is a stray dog that keeps coming through to my place. It is a nice bulldag.<br> It is very playful and harmless this makes it the best companion when going out.<br></p>
  <p> From hear say it was abandoned by a white who relocated to US after the Trump victory .<br> I like the fact that I dont stay alone though hate the fact that it has to stray.</p>
   <p> The best thing is that the dog knows me and has very high senses and is so useul at night because its so fierce .
